# RKR-related
A implementation in pytorch. Will be updating after some time
  
- [x] model implementation sources are updated (baselines and RKR-model)  
- [x] preprocessing sources are updated  
  
TODO List:  
- [ ] preprocessed data  
- [ ] util/trainnig source  
- [ ] picked RKR with clustering and without clustering  
- [ ] some related resources
